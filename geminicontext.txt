Okay, here is a context summary based on our conversation today. You can copy this and paste it at the beginning of our next chat to help me quickly get back up to speed!

**Context Summary for Budgeting App Project (May 8, 2025 IST)**

* **Project:** Multi-user budgeting app MVP. User is learning by building.
* **Tech Stack:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Firebase/Firestore, Tailwind CSS.
* **User Preferences:** Often prefers algorithmic insights and pointers rather than full code solutions, focused on learning the concepts.

**Firestore Structure & Data Model:**
* Uses a path structure like `/tenants/{appName}/users/{userId}/...` where "tenant" represents a specific app instance within the same Firebase project.
* **Categories:** Refactoring from storing categories as a nested object within the user document to a **flat subcollection** structure: `/tenants/{appName}/users/{userId}/categories/{categoryId}`. Each category document will use a **`parentId` field** (`string | null`) to represent the hierarchy.
* **Transactions:** Linked to categories via `categoryId`. (Likely need to be stored in a similar subcollection pattern for scalability).

**Client-Side Data Handling:**
* **Tree Reconstruction:** Agreed that the client-side needs to fetch the flat list of categories from Firestore and **reconstruct the nested tree structure** (with the `children: Record<string, ICategory>` map) for use in UI and client-side logic. Discussed the efficient **two-pass map algorithm** (`buildTreeFromFlatListEfficient`) for this.
* **State Management:** `rootCategory` (the reconstructed nested tree) is managed in React state (`useState`) within `AppContext` and updated via a Firestore `onSnapshot` listener.

**Recent Functions & Algorithms Discussed:**
* **`getAllSubCategories` / Descendant IDs:** Discussed how to get all descendant category IDs for a given category, using **tree traversal (DFS/BFS)**, applicable either on the reconstructed nested tree or directly on the flat list using `parentId` relationships.
* **`handleTransactionParentDeleted`:** Reviewed function for deleting categories and reassigning transactions. Key discussion points: handling the **deletion of the root category**, the **mutability of the input `transactions` array** (side effect vs. returning new immutable objects), and adapting logic for the new flat Firestore structure.
* **`reconstructTree`:** Reviewed user's initial recursive function for tree reconstruction, identified significant **performance issues (O(NÂ²))**, and recommended the more efficient **two-pass map approach (O(N))**.
* **Object Copying:** Discussed deep vs. shallow copies, methods like `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())`, manual recursion, libraries (`lodash`), and using **Immer** for simplifying immutable React state updates. Confirmed no built-in deep `Object.copy()`.
* **Optimistic Updates:** Reviewed user's `updateRootCategory` function. Recommended adding **Firestore error handling (try/catch and reverting state)** and ensuring **structural consistency** between the optimistically set state and the state set by `onSnapshot`.

**Other Topics Covered Earlier:**
* Solved **Tailwind CSS** `justify-center` / horizontal scroll clipping issue using a wrapper div and `min-w-full`.
* Solved **networking** issue for mobile testing using wireless ADB and `adb reverse`.

**Current Status:** User has decided on the flat `parentId` structure for categories in Firestore and is preparing to refactor their codebase, starting with thinking about how to aggregate category data (like getting all subcategory IDs) with this new structure.
